# Understanding Climate Impact

## The Top 3 Contributing Factors

When mapping climate risk outcomes, such as droughts, floods, and heat islands, it's crucial to understand the factors that contribute to or exacerbate these outcomes. These include physical factors, like soil hydrology and slope, as well as human factors, such as urban development patterns, land use, and population density. Each factor plays a significant role in shaping these risks, influencing their frequency, intensity, and impact on communities and ecosystems.

The top three drivers of increased climate-related outcomes within Keystone Heights include the following:

## Precipitation Extremes

Climate change amplifies precipitation extremes, leading to increased instances of both severe flooding and acute water stress. These extremes are further intensified by high population density and specific land use practices.

An elevation sink is essentially a depression in the ground where water accumulates because there's no clear path for it to drain. In these areas, water tends to pond, creating marshy conditions and potentially damaging properties over time.

## Temperature Extremes

Climate change drives more frequent and intense temperature extremes, particularly impacting urban environments. Factors like high population density and specific land use practices exacerbate these extremes, particularly through the urban heat island effect.

## Zoning Characteristics

Zoning codes can directly influence land use and development patterns. The following charts present the percentage of parcels within each zone that exhibit a high risk of climate impact for each potential outcome:
