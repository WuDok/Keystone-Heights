# Understanding Risk and Resilience

## Introduction to GIFT

In the face of escalating climate challenges, understanding the specific risks posed to urban environments is paramount. GIFT (Green Infrastructure for Towns) maps the impacts of climate risk at the granular level of individual parcels across cities. Our focus for this analysis is on [city].

By understanding specific risks that a community faces, and analyzing relevant static factors such as impervious surfaces, low elevation, and other key determinants, we identify the top three impacts to the community as a whole. This detailed insight allows us to identify specific mitigation strategies that are both effective and sustainable, and the analysis results in three distinct, actionable options for each parcel:

- Preserve: Recognizing areas that are best left undisturbed, ensuring they continue to serve as natural buffers and habitats.

- Mitigate: Identifying regions where interventions can reduce the adverse effects of climate risks.

- Retrofit: Pinpointing areas that can be enhanced or transformed to better withstand future climate challenges.

GIFT emphasizes nature-based solutions where appropriate, as well as the integration of refined zoning and design guidelines. These solutions harness the power of nature and thoughtful urban planning to create resilient urban landscapes, promoting both ecological and societal well-being.

Let's work together to protect (city) from climate change and ensure a sustainable future for its residents.

## What Is Risk

Climate risk refers to the potential negative effects of climate change on natural and human systems. It encompasses both the likelihood of a climate-related event occurring and its potential consequences. This includes direct physical impacts, such as extreme weather events and sea-level rise, as well as indirect effects, like economic disruptions or shifts in public health outcomes. As global temperatures continue to rise, understanding and mitigating climate risk becomes increasingly vital for the well-being of communities, economies, and ecosystems.

### National Risk Assessments

As the urgency to address climate change intensifies, several organizations have emerged at the forefront, offering insights and solutions to manage and mitigate climate risks. The climate risks for **CITY** provided by each of the leading organizations follows.

### FEMA National Risk Index

FEMA has identified the following climate risk/risk levels for **City**:

### U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index

The U.S. Climate Vulnerability Index has identified the following climate risk/risk levels for **City**:

### First Street Foundation’s Risk Factor

Risk Factor has identified the following climate risk/risk levels for **City**:

### ClimateCheck

ClimateCheck has identified the following climate risk/risk levels for **City**:

## What Is Resilience

Climate resilience refers to the ability of a system—whether it's a community, city, ecosystem, or economy—to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate-related disturbances and changes. It encompasses strategies and actions that enhance the capacity of these systems to withstand and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change, ensuring their functionality and well-being in the face of evolving environmental challenges. Building climate resilience is crucial for safeguarding both natural and human-made systems, ensuring their sustainability and longevity in a changing climate.

### Traditional Infrastructure

Traditional infrastructure, which includes roads, bridges, buildings, water supply systems, and sewage and stormwater networks, plays a pivotal role in the functioning of modern societies. However, its design and implementation can both contribute to and hinder climate resilience in various ways:

Contributions to Climate Resilience:

- Stability and Protection: Well-designed and maintained traditional infrastructure can offer protection against certain climate-related events. For instance, levees and sea walls can defend against storm surges and flooding.

- Economic Continuity: Infrastructure supports economic activities. When designed with resilience in mind, it ensures that businesses and services can continue to operate during and after climate-related disturbances.

- Redundancy: Some traditional infrastructure systems are designed with backup or alternative routes, ensuring continuity of services even when one part of the system fails.
