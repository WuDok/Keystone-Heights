# Risks - Know Your Environment

## Contributing Factors

The GIFT analysis generated a set of environmental impact maps to address climate change challenges within Keystone Heights, Florida. Using advanced geospatial technologies, these maps visually highlight climate-related vulnerabilities across regions. By consolidating various data sources, they offer a straightforward view of potential impacts.

These tools are essential for decision-makers, planners, and the public to strategize and respond effectively to climate risks.

Impact is relative to the potential impact of climate-related outcomes across your city. Explore the maps to gain a clearer understanding of the challenges ahead.

## Population Density

Population density highlights areas where large numbers of people may be exposed to climate-related hazards. This spatial understanding is crucial for prioritizing interventions and resources to protect vulnerable communities and ensure their safety and well-being.

## Land Cover

Land cover offers a clear picture of how natural and human-made features can influence vulnerability to climate events. Mapping visual insights enables proactive planning and mitigation strategies, ensuring that areas with specific land cover types are managed to optimize resilience against climate threats.

## Proximity to Surface Water & Wetlands

Proximity to water and wetlands pinpoints areas potentially vulnerable to flooding, storm surges, and sea-level rise. This information is vital for informed urban planning and disaster preparedness, ensuring that communities near water bodies are adequately protected from climate-related threats.

## Impervious Surfaces

Mapping impervious surfaces provides critical insights into how urban development impacts climate risk vulnerability. By visually identifying areas with high concentrations of non-absorbent materials, such as concrete and asphalt, it becomes possible to anticipate and mitigate issues like flooding and urban heat islands.

## Tree Canopy

Tree canopy reveals areas that benefit from natural cooling, carbon sequestration, and stormwater absorption provided by trees. Recognizing these zones is crucial for urban planning and conservation efforts, ensuring that regions with dense canopies are preserved and enhanced to combat climate-related challenges.

## Soil Drainage

Soil drainage helps determine areas susceptible to waterlogging, erosion, or drought conditions. Understanding these soil characteristics is essential for land management and infrastructure planning, ensuring resilience against climate-induced soil-related challenges.

## Elevation

Elevation helps pinpoint areas vulnerable to sea-level rise (if applicable), storm surges, and downstream flooding. Understanding topographical variations is essential for informed infrastructure and community planning, ensuring that low-lying regions are adequately protected or adapted to handle climate-induced water threats.

## Slope

Slope aids in determining areas at risk of landslides, erosion, and rapid water runoff during heavy rainfall. Recognizing these gradient variations is crucial for land use planning and infrastructure development, ensuring stability and safety in regions with steep terrains.
