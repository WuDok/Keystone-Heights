# Know Your Environment

## The Top Three Impact areas

The top three drivers of increased climate impact within **city** include the following:

- One
- Two
- Three

## Critical Assets

Understanding the location of critical assets relative to climate risk is essential for prioritizing protective measures and ensuring their longevity and functionality. This knowledge enables cities and organizations to allocate resources effectively, safeguarding vital infrastructure and services from potential climate-related disruptions.

## Land Use

Mapping land use provides a visual representation of areas most susceptible to climate-related impacts based on their current usage. This spatial understanding aids in targeted decision-making, ensuring resources and interventions are directed where they're needed most to enhance resilience.

## Land Cover

Mapping land cover offers a clear picture of how natural and man-made features can influence vulnerability to climate events. Such visual insights enable proactive planning and mitigation strategies, ensuring that areas with specific land cover types are managed to optimize resilience against climate threats.

## Population Density

Mapping population density highlights areas where large numbers of people may be exposed to climate-related hazards. This spatial understanding is crucial for prioritizing interventions and resources to protect vulnerable communities and ensure their safety and well-being.

## Proximity to Surface Water & Wetlands

Mapping proximity to water and wetlands pinpoints areas potentially vulnerable to flooding, storm surges, and sea-level rise. This information is vital for informed urban planning and disaster preparedness, ensuring that communities near water bodies are adequately protected from climate-related threats.

## Soil Drainage

Mapping soil drainage helps determine areas susceptible to waterlogging, erosion, or drought conditions. Understanding these soil characteristics is essential for land management and infrastructure planning, ensuring resilience against climate-induced soil-related challenges.

## Tree Canopy

Mapping tree canopy reveals areas that benefit from natural cooling, carbon sequestration, and stormwater absorption provided by trees. Recognizing these zones is crucial for urban planning and conservation efforts, ensuring that regions with dense canopies are preserved and enhanced to combat climate-related challenges.

## Elevation

Mapping elevation helps pinpoint areas vulnerable to sea-level rise, storm surges, and downstream flooding. Understanding topographical variations is essential for informed infrastructure and community planning, ensuring that low-lying regions are adequately protected or adapted to handle climate-induced water threats.

## Slope

Mapping slope aids in determining areas at risk of landslides, erosion, and rapid water runoff during heavy rainfall. Recognizing these gradient variations is crucial for land use planning and infrastructure development, ensuring stability and safety in regions with steep terrains.

## Sea Level Rise

IF APPLICABLE
Mapping sea level rise highlights areas that are, or will become, susceptible to coastal flooding, erosion, and habitat loss. This information is vital for coastal planning, infrastructure adaptation, and community preparedness to safeguard assets and populations from the escalating threats of rising seas.
