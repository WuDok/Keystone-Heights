# Know Your Environment

The GIFT analysis generated a set of environmental impact maps to address climate change challenges within Keystone Heights, Florida. Using advanced geospatial technologies, these maps visually highlight climate-related vulnerabilities across regions. By consolidating various data sources, they offer a straightforward view of potential impacts.

These tools are essential for decision-makers, planners, and the public to strategize and respond effectively to climate risks.

Impact is relative to the potential impact of climate-related outcomes across your city. Explore the maps to gain a clearer understanding of the challenges ahead.

## Precipitation Extremes

Climate change amplifies precipitation extremes, leading to increased instances of both severe flooding and acute water stress. These extremes are further intensified by high population density and specific land use practices.

An elevation sink is essentially a depression in the ground where water accumulates because there's no clear path for it to drain. In these areas, water tends to pond, creating marshy conditions and potentially damaging properties over time.

## Temperature Extremes

Climate change drives more frequent and intense temperature extremes, particularly impacting urban environments. Factors like high population density and specific land use practices exacerbate these extremes, particularly through the urban heat island effect.

## The Top Three Contributing Factors

The top three drivers of increased climate-related outcomes within Keystone Heights include the following:

- One
- Two
- Three

## Zoning Characteristics

Zoning codes can directly influence land use and development patterns. The following charts present the percentage of parcels within each zone that exhibit a high risk of climate impact for each potential outcome:

CHART 1: Precipitation Extremes: Flooding

CHART 2: Precipitation Extremes: Water stress

CHART 3: Temperature Extremes: Heat island effect

## Contributing Factors

When mapping climate risk outcomes, such as droughts, floods, and heat islands, it's crucial to understand the contributing factors. These include physical factors, like soil hydrology and slope, as well as human factors, such as urban development patterns, land use, and population density. Each factor plays a significant role in shaping these risks, influencing their frequency, intensity, and impact on communities and ecosystems.

### Land Cover

Mapping land cover offers a clear picture of how natural and man-made features can influence vulnerability to climate events. Such visual insights enable proactive planning and mitigation strategies, ensuring that areas with specific land cover types are managed to optimize resilience against climate threats.

### Population Density

Mapping population density highlights areas where large numbers of people may be exposed to climate-related hazards. This spatial understanding is crucial for prioritizing interventions and resources to protect vulnerable communities and ensure their safety and well-being.

### Proximity to Surface Water & Wetlands

Mapping proximity to water and wetlands pinpoints areas potentially vulnerable to flooding, storm surges, and sea-level rise. This information is vital for informed urban planning and disaster preparedness, ensuring that communities near water bodies are adequately protected from climate-related threats.

NOTES: There are 2 different layers. Do we want a surface & wetland or should it be combined?

### Soil Drainage

Mapping soil drainage helps determine areas susceptible to waterlogging, erosion, or drought conditions. Understanding these soil characteristics is essential for land management and infrastructure planning, ensuring resilience against climate-induced soil-related challenges.

### Tree Canopy

Mapping tree canopy reveals areas that benefit from natural cooling, carbon sequestration, and stormwater absorption provided by trees. Recognizing these zones is crucial for urban planning and conservation efforts, ensuring that regions with dense canopies are preserved and enhanced to combat climate-related challenges.

### Elevation

Mapping elevation helps pinpoint areas vulnerable to sea-level rise, storm surges, and downstream flooding. Understanding topographical variations is essential for informed infrastructure and community planning, ensuring that low-lying regions are adequately protected or adapted to handle climate-induced water threats.
